NVIDIA Deep learning Dataset Synthesizer (NDDS)
===============================================


Something you should know:
--------
Branch 4.25: 
Just make some modifications based on original code of v1.2.2 to support UE4 4.25 version.
https://github.com/NVIDIA/Dataset_Synthesizer/pull/47#issue-352692037

https://github.com/NVIDIA/Dataset_Synthesizer/pull/89#issue-507817738

Branch 4.25-packaging:
Enable it to support for packaging while the Branch 4.25 is not. But not sure if it exsits some bugs or something wrong since I am not quite familiar with UE4 coding.


Overview
--------

**NDDS** is a UE4 plugin from NVIDIA to empower computer vision researchers to export high-quality synthetic images with metadata. NDDS supports images, segmentation, depth, object pose, bounding box, keypoints, and custom stencils. In addition to the exporter, the plugin includes different components for generating highly randomized images. This randomization includes lighting, objects, camera position, poses, textures, and distractors, as well as camera path following, and so forth. Together, these components allow researchers to easily create randomized scenes for training deep neural networks.

**`RELEASE NOTES: 4.22 known issue`**

<!--This NDDS version uses UE4 version `4.22` with the following release note: -->
> If you are using material randomization with more than 10 objects which change materials every frame, you might encounter a hang when stopping the play-in-editor session.  The capturing process will still work, but the `uniform buffer memory` will keep increasing and when user stops the capture session, it takes UE extended time to release the memory.  If it takes too long after stopping the play-in-editor session, we recommend to simply shutdown the editor and restart it.  The only other workaround is to keep using UE4.21, which requires use of NDDS v1.1.
> 
> This problem is specific to UE4 4.22, as it now automatically uses mesh instancing to improve the performance when rendering a large quantity of meshes.  Now, every time a new mesh is created or its material is changed, the `uniform buffer memory` allocation is increased.          
> 
> This problem affects both DirectX and OpenGL users.  Although Vulkan doesn't get affected by this, Vulkan doesn't capture depth and class segmentation.


Motivation
----------
Training and testing deep learning systems is an expensive and involved task due to the need for hand-labeled data. This is problematic when the task demands expert knowledge or not-so-obvious annotations (e.g., 3D bounding box vertices).  In order to overcome these limitations we have been exploring the use of simulators for generating labeled data. We have shown in [1,2] that highly randomized synthetic data can be used to train computer vision systems for real-world applications, thus showing successful domain transfer.
